# :snake: Pythonic Programming

The purpose of this repository and accompanying website is to provide
straightforward Python programming examples with brief descriptions of the
code. If you're looking for indepth articles, then I suggest you look
elsewhere. The website is available at https://gavinw.me/pythonic while code
examples such as scripts, modules, and packages are located in the
repository's `examples` folder.
